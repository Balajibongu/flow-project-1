# Challenge 1
Creating the First Smart Contract Using Cadence

# Challenge Description
This project explores essential functions and variables introduced in various modules through Cadence. The primary goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of structs and arrays within the context of programming.

# Getting Started
Running the Program
To execute this program, utilize the flow-playground, an online Cadence IDE. To begin, visit the play.flow website at https://play.flow.com/

Begin by crafting the smart contract, forming a new struct according to your preferences. Subsequently, create a function capable of adding to the array. Execute the function in a transaction to modify or incorporate new data into the array. Lastly, employ a script to observe the changes made to the blockchain.

# Personal Observation
I found the experience of coding with FLOW to be quite enjoyable! While the concept initially seemed unfamiliar, consistent practice and exploration have afforded me a solid grasp of the language and its concepts. I look forward to exploring additional modules and courses provided by MetaCrafters to further enhance my proficiency and skills in blockchain development.
